# Test: SAMOYED=0 bypass mode
#
# This test verifies that the SAMOYED=0 environment variable correctly bypasses
# all hook execution. This feature is essential for:
# - CI/CD pipelines that need to skip hooks
# - Emergency commits when hooks are broken
# - Automated tools that need to bypass validation
#
# Samoyed checks SAMOYED=0 in two places:
# 1. In the Rust code during init (check_bypass_mode function)
# 2. In the wrapper script during hook execution (line 49)
