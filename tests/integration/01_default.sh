# Test: Basic Samoyed initialization and hook execution
#
# This test verifies the core functionality of Samoyed:
# 1. Initializing Samoyed with default settings
# 2. Verifying the directory structure is created correctly
# 3. Checking that core.hooksPath is set properly
# 4. Creating a pre-commit hook that fails
# 5. Verifying that the failing hook blocks commits
#
# This is the most fundamental test - if this fails, nothing else will work.
