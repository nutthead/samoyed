# Test: Running Samoyed from a subdirectory
#
# This test verifies that Samoyed correctly finds the git repository root
# when executed from a subdirectory. This is crucial because developers
# often work in subdirectories of their projects.
#
# Samoyed uses 'git rev-parse --show-toplevel' to find the repository root,
# so it should work correctly regardless of the current working directory.
