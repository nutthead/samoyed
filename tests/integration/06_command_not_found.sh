# Test: Exit code 127 (command not found) handling
#
# This test verifies that Samoyed's wrapper script properly handles exit code 127,
# which indicates "command not found". The wrapper script (assets/samoyed) has
# special handling for this exit code (lines 68-70) that provides an additional
# error message about the PATH.
#
# This is important for debugging when hooks fail due to missing commands.
