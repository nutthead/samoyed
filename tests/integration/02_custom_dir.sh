# Test: Custom directory support
#
# This test verifies that Samoyed can be initialized with a custom directory
# name instead of the default .samoyed directory. This is important for users
# who want to organize their hooks differently or avoid conflicts with other tools.
#
# Tests:
# 1. Initialize with custom directory name
# 2. Verify structure is created in the custom location
# 3. Verify core.hooksPath points to the custom location
# 4. Verify hooks work from the custom location
