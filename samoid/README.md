A modern, fast, and secure Git hooks manager written in Rust. Samoid is a reimplementation of Husky with improved performance, better error handling, and enhanced security features.

## Features

- üöÄ **Fast**: Built with Rust for optimal performance
- üîí **Secure**: Comprehensive path validation and security checks
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robust**: Detailed error handling with actionable suggestions
- üß™ **Well-tested**: 100% test coverage with comprehensive integration tests
- üåç **Cross-platform**: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
- üì¶ **Zero dependencies**: No runtime dependencies beyond Git

## Installation

```bash
cargo install samoid
```

## Quick Start

Initialize Git hooks in your repository:

```bash
samoid init
```

This will:
1. Configure Git to use `.samoid/_` as the hooks directory
2. Create the hooks directory structure
3. Install hook files that delegate to the `samoid-hook` runner

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize hooks (one-time setup)
samoid init

# Install hooks with custom directory
samoid init --hooks-dir custom-hooks
```

### Environment Variables

- `SAMOID=0` - Skip hook installation entirely
- `SAMOID_DEBUG=1` - Enable debug logging

## Architecture

Samoid uses a dual-binary architecture:

- **`samoid`**: CLI interface for initialization and management
- **`samoid-hook`**: Lightweight hook runner executed by Git

This separation ensures minimal overhead during Git operations while providing rich functionality for setup and management.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85+ (Rust 2024 edition)
- Git

### Building

```bash
# Build debug version
cargo build

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Testing

The project uses comprehensive testing with dependency injection:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test categories
cargo test --test installation_tests
cargo test --test validation_tests
cargo test --test error_handling_tests

# Run platform-specific tests
cargo test --test linux_tests    # Linux only
cargo test --test macos_tests    # macOS only
cargo test --test windows_tests  # Windows only
```

### Code Coverage

Generate coverage reports:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin --out html --output-dir target/coverage
```
