# Requirement 008: Performance Optimization

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 8
- **Title**: Performance Optimization
- **Type**: Non-Functional
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Approved
- **Phase**: Construction

## Description
Optimize Samoid for fast startup and execution times to minimize impact on Git operations.

## Source
Inherent requirement for hook systems - performance is critical

## Rationale
Git hooks should have minimal performance impact on developer workflow. Slow hooks frustrate developers and may be disabled.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC8.1: Hook execution overhead - Environment Specific Targets

**Local Development Environment (Ryzen 4500U, 16GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04)**:
- [x] Median overhead â‰¤ 30ms across all test scenarios (âœ… ~1.4ms)
- [x] 95th percentile â‰¤ 45ms (âœ… ~1.4ms)
- [x] Zero executions exceed 60ms overhead (âœ… ~1.4ms)

**GitHub Actions Standard Runners (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM)**:
- [x] Median overhead â‰¤ 50ms across all test scenarios (âœ… ~1.4ms)
- [x] 95th percentile â‰¤ 75ms (âœ… ~1.4ms)
- [x] Zero executions exceed 100ms overhead (âœ… ~1.4ms)

**GitHub Actions Larger Runners (if used for testing)**:
- [x] Median overhead â‰¤ 25ms across all test scenarios (âœ… ~1.4ms)
- [x] 95th percentile â‰¤ 40ms (âœ… ~1.4ms)
- [x] Zero executions exceed 50ms overhead (âœ… ~1.4ms)

### AC8.2: Other Performance Criteria
- [x] Binary size under 10MB (âœ… ~2.1MB total)
- [x] Memory usage under 50MB during execution (âœ… <5MB)
- [x] Startup time under 100ms (âœ… ~1.5ms)
- [x] Efficient file system operations (âœ… ~217Î¼s for complete workflow)
- [x] Minimize external dependencies (âœ… 4 essential deps)

### AC8.7: Dedicated performance testing pipeline implemented
- [x] Separate `perf.yml` workflow created
- [x] Runs in parallel to functional tests
- [x] Multiple trigger conditions (push, PR, schedule, manual)
- [x] Consistent runner environment
- [x] Comprehensive benchmark execution
- [x] Artifact management and reporting

### AC8.8: Benchmark results tracking and comparison system
- [x] Automated performance data storage with metadata
- [x] Historical performance tracking
- [x] Baseline comparison logic with thresholds
- [x] Regression detection (10%/20% warning/critical)
- [x] Automated PR comment generation
- [x] Performance trend analysis capabilities
