# Requirement 011: Release Management and Distribution

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 11
- **Title**: Release Management and Distribution
- **Type**: Functional
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Approved
- **Phase**: Transition

## Description
Implement a comprehensive release management strategy for distributing Samoid binaries across multiple platforms and package managers, ensuring easy installation and updates for users.

## Source
Industry best practices for CLI tool distribution and semantic versioning

## Rationale
Professional release management ensures users can easily install and update Samoid through their preferred package manager. Automated releases reduce manual errors and provide consistent distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Semantic versioning (SemVer) compliance
- [ ] Automated changelog generation from conventional commits
- [ ] Multi-platform binary distribution (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Cryptographic signing of release artifacts
- [ ] Package manager support:
  - [ ] Cargo (crates.io) for Rust developers
  - [ ] Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
  - [ ] Scoop/Chocolatey (Windows)
  - [ ] APT/YUM repositories (Linux)
  - [ ] Direct binary downloads from GitHub releases
- [ ] Installation script for quick setup (`curl | sh` pattern)
- [ ] Version management in Cargo.toml
- [ ] Pre-release and beta channel support
- [ ] Release notes with breaking changes clearly marked
- [ ] Backwards compatibility policy documentation

## Release Process

### Version Bumping
- Use conventional commits to determine version bump type
- Update version in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock
- Generate changelog from commit history
- Create git tag with version

### Binary Distribution
- **Targets**:
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
  - `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (static linking)
  - `x86_64-apple-darwin`
  - `aarch64-apple-darwin` (Apple Silicon)
  - `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  - `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

### Package Manager Integration
- **Homebrew Formula**: `samoid.rb` in tap repository
- **Cargo**: Publish to crates.io with proper metadata
- **Install Script**: Detect platform and download appropriate binary

### Release Channels
- **Stable**: Production-ready releases (v1.0.0)
- **Beta**: Pre-release testing (v1.0.0-beta.1)
- **Nightly**: Automated builds from main branch

## Dependencies
- GitHub Releases API
- Cross-compilation toolchains
- Package manager repositories
- GPG/code signing certificates
- CDN for binary distribution (optional)

## Effort
7 story points

## Planned For Iteration
Sprint 3

## Labels
- `release`
- `distribution`
- `packaging`
- `ðŸš€ phase: transition`

## Traceability

### Use Cases
- User installs Samoid via their preferred package manager
- Developer updates to latest version with single command
- CI/CD system downloads specific version for testing
- Security-conscious user verifies binary signatures

### Test Cases
- Test installation via each package manager
- Verify binary signatures and checksums
- Test upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- Validate installation script on all platforms
- Test pre-release channel functionality

### Design Elements
- Release automation scripts
- Package manager configuration files
- Installation script with platform detection
- Version bumping utilities
- Changelog generation from commits
