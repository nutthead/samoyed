[This issue](https://github.com/nutthead/samoid/issues/8) is quite low-detail and ambiguous and open to interpretation.

Read the current state of the code in [source code](file:samoid/), and for each acceptance criterion, ultrathink add a section to the story that makes the requirement very clear, unambiguous, and blocked to subjective interpretation.

## Before
```md
## Summary
Optimize Samoid for fast startup and execution times to minimize impact on Git operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hook execution overhead less than 50ms
- [ ] Binary size under 10MB
- [ ] Memory usage under 50MB during execution
- [ ] Startup time under 100ms
- [ ] Efficient file system operations
- [ ] Minimize external dependencies

## Priority: Medium
**Effort:** 4 story points
**Phase:** Construction

## Source
Inherent requirement for hook systems - performance is critical


## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: #1, #2, #3, #4 (Core functionality must be complete)
- **Requires**: #5 (Test Infrastructure for benchmarking)
- **See also**: #11 (CI/CD Pipeline for automated performance testing)

Performance optimization should only happen after core functionality is complete and we have proper benchmarking in place.
```
