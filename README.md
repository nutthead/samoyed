## Installation

Samoyed is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/samoyed):

```bash
cargo install samoyed
```

## Verifying Release Signatures

All Samoyed release binaries are cryptographically signed with GPG to ensure authenticity and integrity. This protects against tampering and supply chain attacks.

### Quick Verification

For users who want to quickly verify a download:

```bash
# Download and import our public key
curl -sL https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/latest/download/samoyed-release-public.key | gpg --import

# Verify a binary (replace with your downloaded file)
gpg --verify samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.asc \
             samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

### Step-by-Step Verification Instructions

#### 1. Import the Samoyed Public Key

Download and import our signing key from the latest release:

```bash
# Download the public key
curl -sL https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/latest/download/samoyed-release-public.key -o samoyed-release-public.key

# Import the key into your GPG keyring
gpg --import samoyed-release-public.key
```

#### 2. Verify Key Fingerprint

**Critical Security Step**: Always verify the key fingerprint matches our official key:

```bash
gpg --fingerprint 02D1B70CF6D841EEE6876E13F7A6F8331CBBC51F
```

Expected output should show:
```
pub   ed25519 2025-01-01 [SC] [expires: 2035-01-01]
      02D1 B70C F6D8 41EE E687  6E13 F7A6 F833 1CBB C51F
uid           Behrang Saeedzadeh <hello@behrang.org>
sub   ed25519 2025-01-01 [E] [expires: 2035-01-01]
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning**: If the fingerprint doesn't match exactly, do not proceed. This could indicate a compromised release.

#### 3. Download Release Files

Download the binary and its signature from the [releases page](https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases):

```bash
# Example for Linux x86_64 (adjust for your platform)
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/download/v0.1.10/samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/download/v0.1.10/samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.asc
```

#### 4. Verify the Signature

```bash
gpg --verify samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.asc \
             samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

**Expected Output** (successful verification):
```
gpg: Signature made [date] using EdDSA key ID 1CBBC51F
gpg: Good signature from "Behrang Saeedzadeh <hello@behrang.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

The warning is normal unless you've explicitly trusted our key in your keyring.

#### 5. Verify Checksums (Optional but Recommended)

For additional security, verify the SHA256 checksums:

```bash
# Download checksums and signature
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/download/v0.1.10/CHECKSUMS.txt
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/download/v0.1.10/CHECKSUMS.txt.asc

# Verify checksums signature
gpg --verify CHECKSUMS.txt.asc CHECKSUMS.txt

# Verify your binary's checksum
sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS.txt --ignore-missing
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### Linux

Linux distributions typically have GPG pre-installed. If not:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnupg

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo dnf install gnupg2
# or for older systems: sudo yum install gnupg2

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gnupg
```

#### macOS

Install GPG using Homebrew:

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install GPG
brew install gnupg
```

Alternative: Download [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/) for a GUI experience.

#### Windows

**Option 1: GPG4Win (Recommended)**
1. Download and install [GPG4Win](https://gpg4win.org/download.html)
2. Use Kleopatra (GUI) or `gpg` command in Command Prompt/PowerShell

**Option 2: Git for Windows**
If you have Git for Windows installed, GPG is included:
```cmd
# Use Git Bash terminal
gpg --version
```

**Option 3: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
```bash
# In WSL terminal
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnupg
```

**PowerShell Example**:
```powershell
# Import key
gpg --import samoyed-release-public.key

# Verify signature
gpg --verify samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip.asc samoyed-0.1.10-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "gpg: command not found"

**Cause**: GPG is not installed or not in your PATH.

**Solutions**:
- **Linux**: Install via package manager (see platform instructions above)
- **macOS**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install gnupg`
- **Windows**: Install GPG4Win or use Git Bash

#### "gpg: Can't check signature: No public key"

**Cause**: You haven't imported our public key yet.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Import the public key first
curl -sL https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/latest/download/samoyed-release-public.key | gpg --import
```

#### "gpg: BAD signature"

**Cause**: The file has been tampered with or corrupted.

**Solutions**:
1. **Re-download** the file and signature from GitHub releases
2. **Verify the download URL** - ensure you're downloading from `github.com/nutthead/samoyed`
3. **Check file integrity** - compare file size with the release page
4. **Report the issue** if problem persists

#### "WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature"

**Cause**: This is normal behavior. GPG warns when you haven't explicitly trusted a key.

**This is NOT an error**. The important part is seeing "Good signature from...".

**To remove the warning** (optional):
```bash
# Trust our key (do this only after verifying the fingerprint)
gpg --edit-key 02D1B70CF6D841EEE6876E13F7A6F8331CBBC51F
# Type "trust" then "5" (ultimate trust) then "y" then "quit"
```

#### "gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device"

**Cause**: GPG agent configuration issue (usually on headless systems).

**Solution**:
```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to make permanent
```

#### Signature file not found

**Cause**: You're trying to verify a file without downloading its `.asc` signature.

**Solution**: Always download both files:
```bash
# Download binary
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/download/v0.1.10/samoyed-0.1.10-linux.tar.gz
# Download signature
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/download/v0.1.10/samoyed-0.1.10-linux.tar.gz.asc
```

#### Old GPG version compatibility

**Cause**: Very old GPG versions (< 2.1) may not support Ed25519 keys.

**Solution**:
- **Update GPG** to version 2.1 or newer
- **Check version**: `gpg --version`
- Most systems from 2014+ have compatible versions

#### Network issues downloading keys

**Cause**: Firewall or network restrictions.

**Alternative methods**:
```bash
# Method 1: Direct download
wget https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/releases/latest/download/samoyed-release-public.key

# Method 2: From repository
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nutthead/samoyed/main/samoyed-release-public.key

# Method 3: Manual import (copy key content and save to file)
cat > samoyed-release-public.key << 'EOF'
[paste key content here]
EOF
```

### Verification Best Practices

1. **Always verify signatures** before extracting or running binaries
2. **Verify the key fingerprint** against multiple sources (GitHub, documentation, social media)
3. **Use secure download channels** - always download from `github.com/nutthead/samoyed`
4. **Keep GPG updated** - use recent versions for best security and compatibility
5. **Report suspicious activity** - if verification fails, report it immediately

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from Dual-Binary Versions (v0.1.x)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Samoyed has migrated from a dual-binary architecture (`samoyed` + `samoyed-hook`) to a unified single binary (`samoyed` with `hook` subcommand).

#### What Changed

- **Before**: `exec samoyed-hook "pre-commit" "$@"`
- **After**: `exec samoyed hook "pre-commit" "$@"`

#### Migration Steps

1. **Update Samoyed**: Install the latest version
   ```bash
   cargo install samoyed
   ```

2. **Re-initialize Your Hooks**: This updates your `.samoyed/_/*` files to use the new unified binary
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Standard re-initialization (recommended)
   # Safe to run multiple times, updates hooks only if needed
   samoyed init

   # Option 2: Force re-initialization (explicit migration)
   # Explicitly overwrites all hook files to ensure complete migration
   samoyed init -f _
   ```

   **When to use each option:**
   - Use `samoyed init` for normal migration (safe, non-destructive)
   - Use `samoyed init -f _` if you want to force complete re-creation of all hook files

3. **Verify Migration**: Check that your hook files now reference `samoyed hook`
   ```bash
   cat .samoyed/_/pre-commit
   # Should show: exec samoyed hook "$(basename "$0")" "$@"
   ```

#### Deprecation Timeline

- **Now**: `samoyed-hook` binary still works but shows deprecation warnings
- **September 1, 2025**: `samoyed-hook` binary will be removed entirely
- **Recommended**: Migrate immediately to avoid future issues

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Ensure you have the latest version: `samoyed --version`
- Re-run `samoyed init` to refresh all hook files
- Check that `samoyed hook --help` works

## Quick Start

Initialize Git hooks in your repository:

```bash
samoyed init
```

This will:
1. Configure Git to use `.samoyed/_` as the hooks directory
2. Create the hooks directory structure
3. Install hook files that delegate to the `samoyed` binary

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize hooks (one-time setup)
samoyed init

# Install hooks with custom directory
samoyed init --hooks-dir custom-hooks
```

## Architecture

Samoyed uses a three-layer architecture that provides both flexibility and performance:

### Binary Component

- **`samoyed`**: Unified binary for both CLI interface and hook execution

### Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Git as Git
    participant Hook as .samoyed/_/pre-commit
    participant Runner as samoyed hook
    participant Config as samoyed.toml
    participant Script as .samoyed/scripts/pre-commit
    participant Shell as Shell

    Git->>Hook: git commit triggers
    Hook->>Runner: exec samoyed hook "pre-commit" "$@"

    Runner->>Config: 1. Check for [hooks] pre-commit

    alt Command found in samoyed.toml
        Config-->>Runner: "cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy"
        Runner->>Shell: Execute command via shell
        Shell-->>Runner: Exit code
    else No command in samoyed.toml
        Runner->>Script: 2. Look for .samoyed/scripts/pre-commit
        alt Script exists
            Runner->>Script: Execute script file
            Script-->>Runner: Exit code
        else No script found
            Runner-->>Git: Exit silently (0)
        end
    end

    Runner-->>Git: Propagate exit code
```

### Directory Structure

When you run `samoyed init`, three key components are created:

#### 1. `samoyed.toml` - Primary Configuration
**Raison d'√™tre**: The primary configuration mechanism where you define commands for each hook.

```toml
[hooks]
pre-commit = "cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
pre-push = "cargo test --release"
```

#### 2. `.samoyed/_/` - Git Hook Delegation Layer
**Raison d'√™tre**: Git integration. These files tell Git "when you want to run a hook, call samoyed hook instead."

All files contain identical delegation code:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
exec samoyed hook "$(basename "$0")" "$@"
```

Git's `core.hooksPath=.samoyed/_` points here, so `git commit` ‚Üí `.samoyed/_/pre-commit` ‚Üí `samoyed hook`.

#### 3. `.samoyed/scripts/` - Fallback & Examples
**Raison d'√™tre**: Fallback mechanism for complex scenarios and examples for users who prefer script files.

### Two-Tier Lookup System

The hook runner implements a sophisticated two-tier lookup:

1. **Primary**: Check `samoyed.toml` for a command string
2. **Fallback**: Look for executable script in `.samoyed/scripts/`

This provides maximum flexibility:
- **Simple cases**: Use TOML configuration for straightforward commands
- **Complex cases**: Use full script files for multi-line logic or complex workflows

### Environment Variables

- `SAMOYED=0` - Skip all hook execution (useful for CI/deployment)
- `SAMOYED=1` - Normal execution mode (default)
- `SAMOYED=2` - Enable debug mode with detailed script tracing

### Performance Design

This architecture ensures minimal overhead:
- Git only spawns one process: `samoyed hook`
- No file system scanning during execution
- Direct command execution via shell when possible
- Graceful fallback with silent exit when no hooks are defined
