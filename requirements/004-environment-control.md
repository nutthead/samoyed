# Requirement 004: Environment Control System

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 4
- **Title**: Environment Control System
- **Type**: Functional
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Approved
- **Phase**: Construction

## Description
Implement environment variable controls for disabling hooks globally or enabling debug mode, providing flexibility for different development scenarios.

## Source
Reverse engineered from multiple files showing HUSKY environment variable usage

## Rationale
Developers need the ability to disable hooks during certain operations (rebasing, CI) or enable debugging when troubleshooting hook issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Respect `HUSKY=0` to completely skip hook installation and execution
- [ ] Support `HUSKY=2` for debug mode with detailed tracing
- [ ] Check environment variables during both installation and execution phases
- [ ] Provide clear feedback when hooks are disabled
- [ ] Support temporary and persistent hook disabling
- [ ] Document environment variable behavior

## Dependencies
- Environment variable access
- Logging/tracing capabilities

## Effort
3 story points

## Planned For Iteration
Sprint 2

## Labels
- `environment`
- `configuration`
- `debugging`
- `ðŸ”¨ phase: construction`

## Traceability

### Use Cases
- Developer disables hooks during git rebase
- CI system runs without hooks using HUSKY=0
- Developer enables debug mode to troubleshoot hook issues

### Test Cases
- Test HUSKY=0 prevents installation
- Test HUSKY=0 prevents execution
- Test HUSKY=2 enables debug output
- Test environment variable inheritance

### Design Elements
- Environment detection utilities
- Debug/trace logging system
- Configuration management
