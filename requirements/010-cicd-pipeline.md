# Requirement 010: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 10
- **Title**: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- **Type**: Non-Functional
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Approved
- **Phase**: Construction

## Description
Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and quality checks for the Samoid project across all supported platforms.

## Source
Best practices for Rust projects and cross-platform CLI tool development

## Rationale
Automated CI/CD ensures consistent quality, catches bugs early, validates cross-platform compatibility, and provides confidence for releases. GitHub Actions provides native integration with the repository.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build pipeline for all target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Run full test suite on every push and PR
- [ ] Cross-platform matrix testing (test on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Code coverage reporting with threshold enforcement (>90%)
- [ ] Linting and formatting checks (rustfmt, clippy)
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning (cargo audit)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking on PRs to detect regressions
- [ ] Build and store artifacts for each platform
- [ ] Automatic dependency updates with Dependabot
- [ ] PR validation with required status checks
- [ ] Branch protection for main/master branch

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests
- **Jobs**:
  - Lint (rustfmt, clippy)
  - Test (unit, integration, cross-platform)
  - Build (debug and release modes)
  - Coverage (with tarpaulin)
  - Security audit

### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Version tags (v*)
- **Jobs**:
  - Build release binaries for all platforms
  - Create GitHub release with artifacts
  - Generate changelog
  - Publish to crates.io (if applicable)

### Benchmark Workflow (`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Pull requests with performance label
- **Jobs**:
  - Run performance benchmarks
  - Compare against main branch
  - Comment results on PR

## Dependencies
- GitHub Actions runner environments
- Rust toolchain management (rust-toolchain.toml)
- Cross-compilation targets
- Code coverage tools (cargo-tarpaulin)
- Security scanning tools (cargo-audit)

## Effort
6 story points

## Planned For Iteration
Sprint 2

## Labels
- `ci/cd`
- `automation`
- `testing`
- `ðŸ”¨ phase: construction`

## Traceability

### Use Cases
- Developer pushes code and gets immediate feedback
- PR reviewer sees test results and coverage reports
- Release manager triggers automated releases
- Security team monitors vulnerability reports

### Test Cases
- Test workflow triggers on various events
- Verify cross-platform builds succeed
- Test artifact generation and storage
- Validate coverage reporting accuracy
- Test release automation process

### Design Elements
- Reusable workflow components
- Matrix strategy for platform testing
- Caching for faster builds
- Conditional steps based on context
- Secret management for publishing
