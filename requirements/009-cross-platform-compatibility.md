# Requirement 009: Cross-Platform Compatibility

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 9
- **Title**: Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Type**: Non-Functional
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Approved
- **Phase**: Construction

## Description
Ensure Samoid works correctly across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems with proper path handling and shell execution.

## Source
Implied requirement from Husky's cross-platform support

## Rationale
Development teams use different operating systems and need consistent hook behavior across platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Handle Windows vs Unix path separators correctly
- [ ] Support Windows command execution (cmd.exe vs sh)
- [ ] Handle file permissions appropriately per platform
- [ ] Support Windows Git Bash and WSL environments
- [ ] Test on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Handle line ending differences (CRLF vs LF)

## Dependencies
- Cross-platform testing infrastructure
- Platform detection utilities
- Path manipulation libraries

## Effort
6 story points

## Planned For Iteration
Sprint 2

## Labels
- `cross-platform`
- `compatibility`
- `windows`
- `unix`

## Traceability

### Use Cases
- Windows developer works with team using macOS/Linux
- CI/CD pipeline runs on different operating systems
- WSL users need consistent behavior

### Test Cases
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Test in Git Bash and WSL on Windows
- Test path handling across platforms
- Test file permission handling
- Test shell execution differences

### Design Elements
- Platform detection utilities
- Cross-platform path handling
- Shell execution abstraction
