# Requirement 010: Performance Optimization

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 10
- **Title**: Performance Optimization
- **Type**: Non-Functional
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Approved
- **Phase**: Construction

## Description
Optimize Samoid for fast startup and execution times to minimize impact on Git operations.

## Source
Inherent requirement for hook systems - performance is critical

## Rationale
Git hooks should have minimal performance impact on developer workflow. Slow hooks frustrate developers and may be disabled.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hook execution overhead less than 50ms
- [ ] Binary size under 10MB
- [ ] Memory usage under 50MB during execution
- [ ] Startup time under 100ms
- [ ] Efficient file system operations
- [ ] Minimize external dependencies

## Dependencies
- Performance profiling tools
- Benchmarking infrastructure
- Optimization techniques

## Effort
4 story points

## Planned For Iteration
Sprint 3

## Labels
- `performance`
- `optimization`
- `benchmarking`

## Traceability

### Use Cases
- Developer commits frequently without performance penalty
- Large repository operations remain fast
- CI/CD pipeline efficiency

### Test Cases
- Benchmark hook execution time
- Measure binary size and memory usage
- Test with large repositories
- Compare with original Husky performance

### Design Elements
- Performance monitoring utilities
- Efficient data structures
- Optimized file operations
